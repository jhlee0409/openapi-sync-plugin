Show HN: openapi-sync – Sample-Based OpenAPI Code Generator

I got tired of fighting with OpenAPI codegen tools. Orval, openapi-typescript-codegen - they all generate code in their own style. My project uses a custom Axios wrapper with React Query and FSD folder structure, but the generated code never matched. I spent more time tweaking configs than actually shipping features.

So I built a Claude Code plugin that takes a different approach: instead of templates, it scans your codebase, learns the majority patterns (naming conventions, folder structure, HTTP client usage), and generates code that fits in.

What it does:
- Point it at your OpenAPI spec and your existing API files
- It analyzes what patterns your codebase uses most
- Generates new API code that matches

  "Show me one API file, I'll generate 100 more like it"

Usage:

  /plugin install oas@jhlee0409-plugins
  /oas:init https://api.example.com/openapi.json
  /oas:sync

It also does diff-based sync (only processes changed endpoints) and can lint your code against your own majority patterns, not external rules.

All processing happens locally within Claude Code's context. No code is sent anywhere.

Would love to hear if this approach makes sense, and what patterns I should add.
